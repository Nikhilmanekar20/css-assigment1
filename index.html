        <ol class="list" type="1">
        <li>css stands for cascading style dheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>css describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="line"> Css is not necessary</span> <mark> css saves a lot of work</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-decoration-line: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in css file.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="heading">Css can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="list" type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <br>
        <li>Imternal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <br>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file </li>
        <br>
        <li>the most common way to add css is to keep the styles in external css files. However, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and inernalstyle,</mark> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="para">When comparing CSS class vs ID ,the difference is that css class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="para">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the elements.</p> 
    <br>
    <p class="para">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
